## TODO
compare regular GNN using pytorch geometric with GraphTrans
compare also with RL-solver


We can impose different losses to learn the integer version
One of the most recent RL algorithms A2C is the one to improve upon

Visualization or diagram that shows the bounds od and op




We discussed the questions with Stefano



Question 4: good question, has to be tested
